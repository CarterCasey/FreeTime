# FreeTime

## The Idea

[Kumar](http://kumarramanathan.com) deserves the credit for coming up with the idea behind this project. If you ever looked at our google calendars side-by-side, I think you'd realize why he's the one who came up with it, and not me.  

## Plans for the Future

So far there's not much going on with this app, as you can see from the current test version of [the site](http://cartercasey.com/freetime) and poking around. After I'm done at [athenahealth](http://athenahealth.com), I hope to put some effort into making this a real, usable product.
